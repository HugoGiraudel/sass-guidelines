# Translation notes

> **About this file:** when dealing with a translation, please copy this file in your language folder, translate it and fill it appropriately (remove this block though). This file is an important document to maintain as it ensures consistency across all present and future translators.

The purpose of this file is to define some common guidelines for translations performed by several people. As you might know, translating anything from one language to another is usually tricky and subjectivity is commonly present. It becomes important then to explicitly state common translation agreements for a particular language, like the best way to translate a certain expression or which expressions should not be translated at all, for example.
