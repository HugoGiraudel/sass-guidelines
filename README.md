# Sass Guidelines

## Run it locally

[Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es) runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator. To run your own local version of these guidelines, you'll need to:

1. Install Jekyll on your machine: `gem install jekyll`.

2. Put yourself on the `gh-pages` or a `gh-pages` based branch: `git checkout gh-pages`.

3. Run `jekyll serve` and point your browser to `http://localhost:4000`.

More information on how to setup Jekyll on the [official website](http://jekyllrb.com/).
